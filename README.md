# employee-attrition-prediction
A machine learning project to predict employee attrition using data analysis and predictive modeling
# ðŸš€ Employee Attrition Prediction API

This is a **FastAPI-based REST API** that predicts employee attrition using a **Random Forest Classifier**.  
It allows organizations to proactively identify employees likely to leave by analyzing key HR metrics.

## ðŸŽ¯ Model Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**  
A powerful ensemble algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification).
